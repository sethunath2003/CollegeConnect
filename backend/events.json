You can focus on any single disability or multiple disabilities. Your prototype can range from sketches and paper prototypes to digital mock-ups—use your strengths to demonstrate your commitment to accessibility. When planning your project, we strongly encourage you to connect with people with disabilities to learn firsthand about what would make the world more accessible to them. If you or someone on your team is disabled, consider projects that will address your own accessibility barriers. By engaging in conversations with disabled individuals and learning about their experiences, you will gain valuable insights that will inform the development of meaningful and impactful prototypes. Remember, the ultimate goal of Innoquest is to empower disabled individuals and promote inclusivity through innovative solutions. Best of luck on your journey of discovery and innovation!",

Through a combination of advances in algorithms and the adoption of cutting-edge standards, we are able to make the remote application feel as responsive as the one running locally.</p>\r\n<p>With our approach, there is no loss of productivity, either because of laggy user interfaces (as with other remote desktop solutions) or needing to adjust workflows or course materials (as with other remote programming setups). At the same time, you get to take advantage of the limitless resources of the cloud for faster builds, modern streaming technology for better collaboration between students and doubt resolution between students and teachers, and replicating a standard programming setup across all students, so that they don’t need to spend time dealing with boilerplate.</p>\r\n<p>As we grow the platform, we want to collaborate with student and professional clubs as technology partners for their events.

As all of us are aware that good products are not built in less time. But what we believe in is, at least the process can be initiated to build a good product in that time.</p>\r\n<p>We focus on collaboration between participants, so we encourage them to interact among themselves and create a build. This event will focus on new participants who will be attending their first hackathon. We will ensure that they will get <strong>proper mentorship</strong> to build their idea.</p>\r\n<p>The main aim of this event is to help participants grow their network skills and make them aware of all the good work that communities are doing.

        "description": "<p>Power plants are the biggest consumers of coal. Typically a 1000 MW plant consumes about 5 million tonnes of coal annually. India's total coal-based power generation capacity is about 2 lakh MW, which theoretically can consume approximately 1000 million tonnes of coal annually.</p>\r\n<p>Even 10% of that, if replaced with torrefied charcoal will amount to 100 million tonnes of this fuel which will require approximately 165 MTPA of agro residue (considering 60% yield), sufficient to wipe out the entire unused agro residue in the country and thus eliminating the farm fires and produce approx. 20,000 MW of renewable power. The idea has vast potential to increase rural income, provide local employment, cleaning the air by eliminating farm fires and also to generate enormous renewable energy with existing coal power infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>The technology to produce torrefied fuel using agro residue biomass is not easily accessible to small entrepreneurs due to the higher cost of imported machines, lack of sufficient manufacturers, and non-availability of the torrefaction plants having smaller capacity suitable for cottage industry entrepreneurs. To fast-track the development the technology for converting agro residue to charcoals, NVVN, a wholly owned subsidiary of NTPC limited, in partnership with EESL plans to organise a technology challenge Green Charcoal Hackathon. It will leverage the innovative Indian mind to bridge the technology gap, with the prime objective to clean the air by eliminating farm fire, producing renewable energy out of the agro residue, to promote local entrepreneurship, and to increase the income of the farmers.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Nearly half a million road accidents happen every year in India and over hundred and fifty thousand people die every year. Those numbers are comparable to some of the most major natural disasters or even epidemics. Yet road safety elicits less attention that it should. The brightest minds of our generation are making mobility awesome by working on electric vehicles but the other part of making mobility awesome is to end the needless physical harm on our roads.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">How can we make our roads safer ? </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">There are many ways of making our roads safer: prevention and mitigations. Prevention is where we prevent an accident, mitigation is where we do better handling of accidents. Both can make a difference to overall lives lost on roads. Within prevention :</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">We can make roads safer by making safer infrastructure (better light conditions, signage, roads etc.). Let’s call them ‘Where we drive’ factors.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">At another level we can make roads safer by making our vehicles safer - we could call them ‘What we drive’ factors</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">And lastly we could just drive well - the ‘how we drive’ factors.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Goes without saying that if we could improve the ‘how we drive’ - we can achieve safety at the least cost and at an individual level. ‘Where we drive’ &amp; ‘What we drive’ is a much larger canvas of problem solving and needs many stakeholders to make a dent in the problem but ‘How we drive’ interventions can be driven faster. So we want to focus on them for this hackathon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">So how do we solve the problem of making our driving safer - how do we help people drive safer through awareness, through incentives, through gamification, how do we make sure that people are driving safely to start with. That would mean that they are driving within speed limits, not overtaking unnecessarily, braking slowly - so others can adjust, accelerate gently so others can figure out, keeping enough distance between their vehicles and so on.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">For example: experts say that nearly a quarter of accidents happen because of distracted driving - with mobile usage a major part of the problem. So how do we stop people from using their mobile phones while driving ?</span></p>",
